# mere-lock #
`mere-lock` is a utility program to lock screen ( and system wise locking is in
the plan). When the user invoked the program, it locks the screen and wais for 
user interaction - any key press or mouse activity. The program then prompts 
for the secret, usually the user's password, to unlock the screen. When the 
program is invoked without `--password` argument, it will match the password 
with the logged-in user password using the *pam* service. 

User may wish to NOT using the system's user password, instead using a
different one to unlock the screen - it can be done using `--password` argument.

The lock screen is quite configurable, such as
- change the background of the screen
  - color code
  - image path
- change or hide the logo used on the screen
  - image path
- change the background of the password prompt screen
  - color code or image path can
- change or hide the logo used in the password prompt screen
  - image path
- change the font color and size of the messages 

TODOs:
- Restrict on wrong attempts (but why and how?)
  - Record the person who made false attemps? maybe capturing the face using webcam? 
- VT locking
- System locking

### Usage
Simply invoke the 'mere-lock' command. To get out of it, use your current login password.

```shell
$ mere-lock --strict
```
*note:* --strict option will force to validate the configuration used.

If the user wishes to use a temporary password, then the invocation command 
would be:

```shell
$ mere-lock --strict --password secret
```

If the user wishes to use a onetime password requested by screen locker, then the invocation command would be:

```shell
$ mere-lock --strict --password
```
*note:* onetime password is helpful for indirect invocation using any shortcut keys.

If the user wishes to use a calculated password or password generated by other program of choice, 
then the invocation command would be:

```shell
$ date "+%d%m%Y" | xargs mere-lock --strict --password
```
*note:* above command will set the passowrd return by date command at the time of invocation.

If the user wish to lock the screen for 15 minutes, and require the user's login password to unlock:

```shell
$ mere-lock --strict --timeout 15
```

Tips: you can generate a password while invoking, and pass it using xargs!
Tips: you can always use your system passowrd to unlock screen(s)!
